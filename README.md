Creating a Jenkins pipeline that integrates with GitHub. Also, integrating email notifications to inform developers about build status and deployment events. Additionally, for each stage of the pipeline, you will be required to specify or research a tool that can be used for that stage.

Stage 1: Build
Stage 2: Unit and Integration Tests
Stage 3: Code Analysis
Stage 4: Security Scan
Stage 5: Deploy to Staging
